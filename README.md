# MATH-413-lecture-notes

I took notes when taking my MATH 413 (Introduction to Combinatorics) course taught by professor Let√≠cia Mattos in UIUC. I think it could be helpful if I share my notes with others. I included the theorems, corollaries, lemmas, and their proofs in my notes.

I edited them using Typora. If you have it, rendering these Markdown files should be easy and smooth. However, I think you can also use some Visual Studio Code extension for rendering them. 

Right now, I included some images with my own github repository. But I will try to put them  into this repository later. 

I also post my notes on my [personal blog](https://ohuro.me/tags/combinatorics/). These should be easy to read from any device.
