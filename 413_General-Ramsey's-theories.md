# General Ramsey Theories

### General Ramsey on normal graph

<span style="color:#28a745">Notation</span> **General notation for Ramsey theory:**

$K_n \to (K_s,K_t)$ is the assertion that for any coloring of the edges of $K_n$ with red and blue, we can always find a red $K_s$ or a blue $K_t$.

$K_n \not \to (K_s,K_t)$ is the assertion that there exists a coloring of the edges of $K_n$ with red and blue with no red $K_s$ nor blue $K_t$.

<span style="color:#28a745">Notation</span> **Off-diagonal Ramsey numbers:** 

Let $s,t \in \{1,2,3,\ldots\}$. The Ramsey number $R(s,t)$ is the smallest value of $n$ such that $K_n \to (K_s,K_t)$.

$R(s, t) = \operatorname{min}\set{n : \forall c : E(K_n) \to \set{\text{red, blue}}, \exists \text{ red } K_s \text{ or blue }K_t}$

<span style="color:#9650af">Observation</span>

1. $R(s, t) = R(t, s)$
2. $R(2, t) = t$

<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof of observation 2:</span>

$R(2, t) = \operatorname{min}\set{n : \forall c : E(K_n) \to \set{\text{red, blue}}, \exists \text{ red } K_2 \text{ or blue }K_t}$

Need to show two things: 

1. $\exists c : E(K_{t-1}) \to \set{\text{red, blue}} \text{ s.t. } \not \exists \text{ red } K_2 \text{ or blue }K_t$. This holds since we have at most a blue $K_{t-1}$, the two coloring we want are both not satisfied. This property gives us $R(2, t) \geq t$. 
2. $\forall c : E(K_t) \to \text{red, blue, }\exists \text{ red } K_2 \text{ or blue }K_t$. This holds since we either have one red edge, then done. Or all the edges are blue, then blue $K_t$, also done. This property gives us $R(2, t) \leq t$. 



### <span style="color:#3c66b5">Theorem</span>

For all $s, t \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $R(s, t) \leq R(s-1, t) + R(s, t-1)$.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Understanding this proof is important... As we have a more generalized version of Ramsey's theorem below, which has a similar proof. (In a same structure but using much more complicate notations.)

<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>

Suppose you have a complete graph $K_n, n = R(s-1, t) + R(s, t-1)$. Now, fix the coloring $c : E(K_n) \to \{\text{red, blue}\}$.

Goal: to show that $\exists $ red $K_s$ or blue $K_t$.

Take a vertex $v$. Consider their red and blue neighbours of this $v$. Denote $N_R(v), N_B(v)$. We cannot have at the same time that:

- $|N_R(v) \leq R(s-1,t) - 1|$
- $|N_B(v) \leq R(s,t-1) - 1|$

This is because, by contradiction, $n = N_R(v) + N_B(v) + 1 \leq n-1$. 

Two cases: 

- $|N_R(v)| \geq R(s-1, t)$

Inside $N_R(v)$, we can find $K_{s-1}$ red or $K_t$ blue. If $K_t$ blue, done. If $K_{s-1}$ red, also done since we have this $v$ here, adding an extra 1 to $K_{s-1}$. 

- $|N_B(v)| \geq R(s, t-1)$. This has a similar argument.

<span style="color:#3c66b5">Corollary</span>

For all $s, t \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $R(s, t) \leq {{s+t-2} \choose {s-1}}$

<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>

Two observations: 

1. $R(2, t) = t$
2. $R(s, t) \leq R(s-1, t) + R(s, t-1)$.

By induction on $s+t$

Base case: $s+t = 4$.

$R(2, 2) \leq {{2} \choose {1}} = 2$ by (1)

$R(1, 3) \leq {{2} \choose {0}} = 1$

IH: Assume that it is true for $R(s-1, t)$ and $R(s, t-1)$. Let us show that this is true for $R(s, t)$. 

$$
\begin{align*}
R(s, t) \leq R(s-1, t) + R(s, t-1) \\
\leq {{s+t-3} \choose {s-2}} + {{s+t-3} \choose {s-1}}\\
= {{s+t-2} \choose {s-1}} &&\text{by Pascal}
\end{align*}
$$

**Application:** new proof for $R(t) \leq 4^t$: 
$$
R(t, t) \leq {{2t-2} \choose {t-1}} \leq 2^{2t-2} = \frac{4^t}{4}
$$

### Ramsey for many colors on normal graph

$K_n \to (K_{t_1},K_{t_2},\ldots,K_{t_k})$ is the assertion that for any coloring $c:E(K_n)\to \{1,2,\ldots,k\}$ of the edges of $K_n$, there exists an $i$ so that we have a $i$-colored copy of $K_{t_i}$ under $c$.

> Reminder: $E$ here is the notation for edges

<span style="color:#28a745">Notation</span> **Generalized Ramsey numbers:**

The Ramsey number $R(t_1,\ldots,t_k)$ is the smallest value of $n$ such that $K_n \to (K_{t_1},\ldots,K_{t_k})$.

### <span style="color:#3c66b5">Ramsey's Theorem</span>

For any $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and any $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k \in \mathbb{N}$, we have 

$$
R(t_1, \ldots, t_k) \leq \infty
$$


Consider $R(t_1, t_2, t_3) \leq R(R(t_1, t_2), t_3) < \infty$

We want to prove the first inequality as the second one is trivial by definition.

<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>

Let $n \geq (R(R(t_1, t_2), t_3))$

Let $c : E(K_n) \to \{\text{red, blue, green}\}$ by any coloring. First, identify the red and blue color as black. 

Goal: to find red $K_{t_1}$ or blue $K_{t_2}$ or green $K_{t_3}$.

As $R(s, t) < \infty \implies R(R(t_1, t_2), t_3) < \infty$

$\implies$ we find a black clique of size $R(t_1, t_2)$ in $K_n$ under $c$, or a green clique of size $K_{t_3}$. 

Case 1: We find the green $K_{t_3}$, we are done. 

Case 2: We find a black $K_{R(t_1, t_2)}$. In this graph, all edges are red or blue. We are garenteed to find $K_{t_1}$ red or $K_{t_2}$ blue.

### NOW, more general Ramsey on HypergraphüôÉ

Instead of coloring edges(pair of vertices, they are sets of size two), we can color sets! (How cool is that üôÉüôÉüôÉ)

<span style="color:#28a745">Definition</span> Hypergraph

A hypergraph is a pair $(V, E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a collection of subset of $V$. 

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Hypergraph-wikipedia.svg/1200px-Hypergraph-wikipedia.svg.png" alt="Hypergraph - Wikipedia" style="zoom: 20%;" />

Then the maximum number of hyperedges is just $|P(V) - 1|$. (empty set is not included)



<span style="color:#28a745">Notation</span> $r$-uniform hypergraph

Let $r \in \mathbb{N}$. We say that a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(V,E)$ is $r$-uniform if all its hyperedges have $r$ vertices.

<span style="color:#28a745">Definition</span> Complete hypergraph

Let $\mathcal{H} = (V, E)$ be an $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices. We say that $\mathcal{H}$ is a complete hypergraph if every subset of $V$ of size $r$ is a hypergraph of $\mathcal{H}$. That is: 
$$
E = \{A : A \subseteq V \text{ and } |A| = r\}
$$
Observe: $|E(\mathcal{H})| = {{n} \choose {r}}$

<span style="color:#28a745">Notation</span> $K_n^r$ denotes the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph.



<span style="color:#28a745">Notation</span> Ramsey for hypergraphs

$K_n^r \to (K_{t_1}^r,K_{t_2}^r,\ldots,K_{t_k}^r)$ is the assertion that for any coloring $c:E(K_n)\to \{1,2,\ldots,k\}$ of the hyperedges of $K_n^r$, there exists an $i$ so that we have a $i$-colored copy of $K^r_{t_i}$ under $c$.

<span style="color:#28a745">Notation</span> Ramsey numbers for hypergraphs

The Ramsey number $R_r(t_1,\ldots,t_k)$ is the smallest value of $n$ such that $K_n^r \to (K_{t_1}^r,\ldots,K_{t_k}^r)$.

<span style="color:#9650af">Observation</span>

$R_3(3, 10) = 10$

$R_r(r, t) = t$

> All of these are the analogies of Ramsey's theories on normal graph with many colors.



### <span style="color:#3c66b5">Ramsey's theorem for hypergraph</span>

For any $r, k \in \mathbb{N}$ and any $t_1, ..., t_k \in \mathbb{N}$ we have 
$$
R_r(t_1, \ldots, t_k) \leq \infty
$$
<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>

Induction on $r$ and $t_1 + ... + t_k$

> Question: What should be the degree of a vertex so that in its neighbourhood we guarentee (1) $K_{t_1}^r$ 1-colored or (2)$K_{t_2}^r$ 2-colored or  ... 

**Claim:** 
$$
\begin{align*}
R_r(t_1,t_2, t_3) &\leq R_{r-1}(R(t_1-1, t_2, t_3)) \\
&+ R_{r-1}(R(t_1, t_2-1, t_3)) \\
&+ R_{r-1}(R(t_1, t_2, t_3-1))
\end{align*}
$$
Call the right side $n$. 

Fix any coloring $c : E(K_n^r) \to \{\text{red, blue, green}\}$

Goal: to find red $K_{t_1}^r$ or blue $K_{t_2}^r$ or green $K_{t_3}^r$

By pigeonhole principle: 

Let's define the coloring: 

$c' : E(K_{n-1}^{r-1}) \to \{\text{red, blue, green}\}$ as follows:

- $c'(e) = $ $c(v \cup e)$

==The detailed proof goes in the homework...==

Now, there is one interesting application of this Ramsey's theorem for hypergraph. 

### <span style="color:#3c66b5">The happy ending problem</span>

Let $A$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that no three points of $A$ are co-linear. If $n$ is sufficiently large, then $A$ contains $k$ points forming a convex $k$-gon. 

> Solved by Erdos-Szekeres. 

<span style="color:#28a745">Definition</span> The definition of a convex polygon is a bit complicated. But they have this property: 

> In a convex polygon, all [interior angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_angles) are less than or equal to 180 degrees, while in a strictly convex  polygon all **interior angles are strictly less than 180 degrees**. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon)

Some simple cases: 

> Question: How many points in general position guarantee a convex 3-gon? **THREE!**
>
> How many points in general position guarantee a convex 4-gon? Four is not enough. Consider an arrow like 4-gon. 

Suppose we have 5 points in general position (g.p. means no 3 are colinear). Whenever we have a convex 4-gon or 5-gon, we are done. Otherwise, in case (1), draw a line inside the triangle, it crosses two edges. We can see that the two any two points on the line, together with other two points, will form a 4-gon. (I don't know how to argue this using a formal geometry proof, but the intuition should be similar to this.)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloboyxxx/images-for-notes/master/uPic/image-20231004152231308.png" alt="image-20231004152231308" style="zoom: 33%;" />

<span style="color:#eb861c">General Proof</span>

Consider any set of $n = R_4(k,k)$ points in general position: $p_1, \ldots, p_n$.

We define a coloring of $K_n^4$ as follows: 

- Color $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$ blue if these points are in convex position.
- Color them red if they are not covex. 

Then **Ramsey's Theorem** tells us that: $\exists$ monochromatic $K_k^4$. 

> Question: Can all hyperedges be red? What happenwith 5 points in general position?

$K \geq 5 \implies \exists$ convex 4-gon $\implies$ blue edges $\implies$ the monochromatic $k$-clique is blue!

**Conclusion:** we can find $k$ points $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ so that every 4-points are in convex position.

BUT, what's next?  **Hint**: loook at the convex hull. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloboyxxx/images-for-notes/master/uPic/image-20231004154130297.png" alt="image-20231004154130297" style="zoom:25%;" />

Case 1: If we find all these $k$ points forms a convex $k$-gon (case 1), then we are happy. 

Otherwise, in case 2: Choose one vertex, and draw lines to other verticies. If there is a point "inside", it must be inside one of the triangles created. Then those four points forms a non-convex 4-gon, which contradicts our conclution. Then only case 1 exists. $\blacksquare$
