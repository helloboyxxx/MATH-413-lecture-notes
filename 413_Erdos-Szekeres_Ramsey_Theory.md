# Erdos-Szekeres Theorem and Ramsey Theory

### <span style="color:#3c66b5">Erdos-Szekeres Theorem</span>

Given $r, s$ any sequence of distinct real numbers with length at least $(r-1)(s-1)+1$ contains a monotonically increasing subsequence of length $r$ or a monotonically decreasing subsequece of length $s$. 

That is, given the subsequence: $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{(s-1)(r-1)+1}$, we can find: 

- Indicies $i_1 < i_2 <  ...< i_r$ so that $a_{i1} < a_{i2} < ...< a_{ir}$

OR 

- Indicies $j_1 < j_2 <  ...< j_r$ so that $a_{j1} > a_{j2} > ... > a_{jr}$

**Example:** $s = 3, r = 3$, Sequence: $10, 11, 7, 8$ has no such property.

E-S thm is best possible: 

$\exists$ subsequence of length $(s-1)(r-1)$ so that $\not \exists$ increasing subsequence of length $r$ nor a decreasing subsequence of length $s$.

<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>

The subsequence: $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{(s-1)(r-1)+1}$.

For each $i \in \set{1, ..., (s-1)(r-1)+1}$, define a pair $(x_i, y_i)$ as follows:

$x_i = $ the length of the longest increasing subsequence $a_1, ..., a_i$

$y_i = $ the length of the longest decreasing subsequence $a_1, ..., a_i$

**Example:** subsequence $1, 4, 5, 2, 7, 3$

$$
\begin{align*}
(x_1, y_1) = (1, 1)\\
(x_2, y_2) = (2, 1)\\
(x_3, y_3) = (3, 1)\\
(x_4, y_4) = (3, 2)\\
\end{align*}
$$


**Claim 1:** Let $i \in \set{1, ..., (s-1)(r-1)}$

Then, either $x_{i+1} > x_i$ or $y_{i+1} > y_i$

<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof of claim 1:</span>

Let $a_{j1}, a_{j2}, ..., a_{jx_i}$ be the longest increasing subsequence in $a_1, ..., a_i$, ending with $a_i$. So $a_{jx_i} = a_i$

Let $a_{t1}, a_{t2}, ..., a_{ty_i}$ be the longest decreasing subsequence in $a_1, ..., a_i$, ending with $a_i$. So $a_{ty_i} = a_i$

Two options: 

- $a_{i+1} > a_i$, then it contributes to the increasing subsequence: $a_{j1}, ..., a_{jx_i}, a_{i+1}$
- $a_{i+1} < a_i: a_{t_1} , ..., a_{ty_i}, a_{i+1}$

Note that here, $a_{ty_i}$ and $a_{jx_i}$ are both equal to $a_i$



**Claim 2:** Let $i, j \in \set{1, ..., (s-1)(r-1) + 1}$ with $i < j$. Then either $x_j > x_i$ or $y_j > x_i$. This gives us: $(x_i, y_i) \neq (x_j, y_j), \forall j \neq i$

<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof of claim 2:</span>

Same notation as claim 1: 

Let $a_{j1}, a_{j2}, ..., a_{jx_i}$ be the longest increasing subsequence in $a_1, ..., a_i$, ending with $a_i$. So $a_{jx_i} = a_i$

Let $a_{t1}, a_{t2}, ..., a_{ty_i}$ be the longest decreasing subsequence in $a_1, ..., a_i$, ending with $a_i$. So $a_{ty_i} = a_i$

There are two options: 

- $a_j > a_i$. Then we can take $a_j, ..., a_{jx_i}, a_j$ , which give us longer increasing $x_j > x_i$.
- $a_j < a_i$. Then we can take $a_t, ..., a_{ty_i}, a_j$ , which give us longer decreasing $y_j > y_i$.


Now that the two claims are done, we can construct this box that contains $(r-1)(s-1)$ points. Then the extra one point in the 2D space gives us the fact that along one dimension, we have $s$ or $r$ points.

## Graph & Ramsey's theories

<span style="color:#28a745">Definition</span>

A graph is an ordered pair $G = (V, E)$ comprising: 

- $V$, a set of vertices (also called nodes or points)

- $E \subseteq \{\{x,y\}: x,y \in V \text{ and } x \neq y\}$, a set of edges (also called links or lines), which are unordered pairs of vertices. 

<span style="color:#28a745">Definition</span>

- A complete graph is a graph in which each pair of graph vertices is connected by an edge. 

- The complete graph with $n$ vertices is denoted by $K_n$.

<span style="color:#04c2b2">Exercise</span>

What is the number edges in $K_n$?

$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i$, or simply ${{n} \choose {2}}$



### <span style="color:#3c66b5">Theorem of Ramsey</span>

Of six (or more) people, either there are three, each of pair of whom are acquainted, or there are three, each pair of whom are unaquainted. 

In graph theory language: for any coloring of the edges of $K_6$ with red or blue, then there exists at least one monochromatic triangle $K_3$. 



> Question: How many ways to color $K_6$?

There are $e = {{6} \choose {2}} = 15$ edges, so the number of ways is $2^{15}$. It would be horrible to brute force checking all the possibilities.

<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>

Labeling the graph verticies from 1 to 6. 

There are 5 edges starting from 1. By pigeonhole principle, $\exists$ at least 3 edges of the same color. Then there are two cases: 

- $\exists$ at least one red edge among the three verticies connected to 1, forming a red triangle.
- Otherwise, they are all blue, forming a blue triangle. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloboyxxx/images-for-notes/master/uPic/six_vertices_case.png" alt="six_vertices_case" style="zoom: 33%;" />

<span style="color:#28a745">Notation:Â </span>

$K_n \to K_s$ is the assertion that for any coloring of the edges of $K_n$ with red and blue, we can always find a monochromatic $K_s$.

$K_n \not \to K_s$ is the assertion that there exists a coloring of the edges of $K_n$ with red and blue with **no** monochromatic $K_s$.

<span style="color:#28a745">Notation</span> Ramsey number

Let $t \in \set{1, 2, 3,...}$. The Ramsey number $R(t)$ is the smallest value of $n$ such that $K_n \to K_t$.



### <span style="color:#3c66b5">Ramsey's theorem</span>

For every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $R(k) < 4^k$.

<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>: $k$ is fixed

Take $n = 4^k$. Take one vertex, label it $v_1$. $v_1$ has $4^k - 1$ neighbors. 

Note that either $|N_R(v_1)| \geq \frac{4^k}{2}$ or $|N_B(v_1)| \geq \frac{4^k}{2}$. (By pigeonhole)

>  $N_R(v_1) = \set{u:v_1u \text{ is red}}$
>
>  $N_B(v_1) = \set{u:v_1u \text{ is blue}}$



**Step 1:** Let us color $v_1$ blue if $|N_B(v_1)| \geq \frac{4^k}{2}$ and red otherwise. 

Then, restrict our graph to $v_1 \cup N_{c(v_1)}(v_1)$.

**Step 2:** Take $v_2 \in N_{c(v_1)}(v_1)$. Color $v_2$ blue if $|N_B(v_2) \cap N_{c(v_1)}(v_1)| \geq \frac{4^k}{4}$, otherwise, color it red. 

> Because, by pigeonhole, either:
>
> - $|N_B(v_2) \cap N_{c(v_1)}(v_1)|\geq \frac{4^k}{2} / 2$
> - $|N_R(v_2) \cap N_{c(v_1)}(v_1)|\geq \frac{4^k}{2} / 2$

$\vdots$

**Step $i+1$:**

Take $v_{i+1} \in A_i = N_{c(v_1)}(v_1) \cap N_{c(v_2)}(v_2) \cap \cdots \cap N_{c(v_i)}(v_{i+1})$

Note that $|A_i| \geq \frac{4^k}{2^i}$. By pigeonhole, either:

- $|N_B(v_{i+1})| \geq \frac{4^k}{2^{i+1}}$
- $|N_R(v_{i+1})| \geq \frac{4^k}{2^{i+1}}$

Now when we get to $i = 2k-1, |A_{i-1}| \geq \frac{4^k}{2^{2k-1}} = 2$. So we can still color the vertex $v_{i+1}$

According to vertex coloring of $v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_{i}$, select majority color for $v_{i+1}$. This gives us a monochromatic $K_k$ by pigeonhole principle.
